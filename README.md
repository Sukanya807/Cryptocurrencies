# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview & Purpose

The project has been undertaken on behalf of a fictitious investment bank named "Accountability Accounting" that is interested in offering a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning in order to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The final analysis includes the following aspects:

- Preprocessing the data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions using PCA
- Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
- Visualizing cryptocurrencies results
