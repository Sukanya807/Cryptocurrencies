# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview & Purpose

The project has been undertaken on behalf of a fictitious investment bank named "Accountability Accounting" that is interested in offering a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning in order to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The final analysis includes the following aspects:

- Preprocessing the data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions using PCA
- Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
- Visualizing cryptocurrencies results

## Resources

- Data Source: crypto_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook
- Topic: Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Results

The original dataframe contains 1,252 rows. The dataframe has been preprocessed by dropping rows with one or more null values and by filtering on the basis of currently traded cryptocurrencies and coins mined. Following the preprocessing and cleaning, there are in total 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.
